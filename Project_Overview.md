## Projects

### 🔹 Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Consumer Profiles
**Objective:** Understand customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and engagement patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

**Key Contributions:**
- Performed structured exploratory data analysis on customer demographics, spending, and engagement variables
- Identified trends, distributions, correlations, and outliers impacting downstream modeling
- Engineered new features (e.g., age, family size, customer tenure, aggregated spending metrics)
- Built clear and interpretable visualizations to communicate insights effectively

**Outcome:**  
Established a solid analytical foundation for customer segmentation and business recommendations.

### 🔹 Project 2: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
**Objective:** Segment customers into meaningful groups to enable targeted marketing and personalization strategies.

**Key Contributions:**
- Designed a **scikit-learn pipeline** incorporating preprocessing, scaling, and one-hot encoding
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to customer demographic, behavioral, and promotional data
- Determined optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Scores**
- Interpreted cluster outputs and translated them into **actionable customer personas**
- Evaluated clusters from both a statistical and business perspective

**Outcome:**  
Delivered clearly defined customer segments with direct applications to marketing strategy, retention, and revenue optimization.
